# MIT-Linear-Algebra-Learning-Journey

Welcome to my MIT OpenCourseWare Linear Algebra learning journey repository! This repository is for documenting my progress through the MIT 18.06 course, which covers topics such as Ax = b and the Four Subspaces, Least Squares, Determinants and Eigenvalues, Positive Definite Matrices, and more. Join me in learning Linear Algebra which is a fundamental building block in Computer Science, Quantum Computing, Theoretical Physics, and more.
